    question: "What is an Exosome?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>Exosomes are tiny, naturally occurring extracellular vesicles secreted by cells. They’ve become a revolutionary advancement in skincare and regenerative aesthetics due to their ability to repair and rejuvenate the skin at a cellular level.</p>
        <p>Exosomes act like microscopic messengers, encouraging your skin to regenerate by stimulating the production of collagen and elastin – essential for firmness, elasticity, and a more youthful complexion. They also combat external stressors that contribute to ageing and inflammation, making them one of the most effective ingredients in modern aesthetic treatments.</p>
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    question: "How do exosomes compare to other skin treatments?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>Exosomes offer deeper regenerative benefits than many standard skincare treatments. For example, they are now being studied for their effectiveness in treating atopic dermatitis – a chronic inflammatory skin condition affecting 1 in 3 people globally.</p>
        <p>By helping to repair the skin barrier, exosomes reduce inflammation, support hydration, and promote long-term skin health. Their ability to communicate between cells and transfer healing molecules gives them a distinct advantage over many traditional products.</p>
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    question: "What are the benefits of using exosomes on the skin?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>At Beyond The Face, we consistently see the following five key benefits:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Cellular Communication</strong> – Exosomes transfer proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids between cells, stimulating rejuvenation.</li>
          <li><strong>Skin Regeneration</strong> – They enhance collagen and elastin production, improving skin tone, texture, and firmness.</li>
          <li><strong>Anti-Inflammatory Effects</strong> – Exosomes reduce skin inflammation, aiding in conditions like eczema and psoriasis.</li>
          <li><strong>Enhanced Skin Barrier Function</strong> – They boost ceramide production, improving hydration and defence against environmental stress.</li>
          <li><strong>Antioxidant Protection</strong> – Exosomes neutralise free radicals, helping to prevent premature ageing caused by UV damage and pollution.</li>
        </ul>

    question: "Is microneedling RF with exosomes suitable post-surgery?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>Yes – and it’s highly recommended. Consultant Surgeon Mr Darryl Coombes states:</p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic my-2">
          “I’d say it’s almost essential… Getting further support and fine-tuning of the surgical treatment courtesy of Maryna is beneficial in so many ways.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>This treatment is ideal as a postoperative skin support, enhancing healing and refining results following procedures such as the Apex Facelift®.</p>
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Apex Facelift®?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>Developed by Mr Darryl Coombes, the Apex Facelift® is a subtle, modern facial surgery designed to rejuvenate without the obvious signs of surgery.</p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic my-2">
          “Things are subtler now – and people don’t want to be in hospital for a night or two. My Apex facelift makes people look refreshed – and not like they’ve actually had any surgical work done!”
        </blockquote>
        <p>Microneedling RF + exosome treatments are the perfect complement, helping maintain and enhance surgical outcomes.</p>
